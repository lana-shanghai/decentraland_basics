Click the box to send it up, view my precious CryptoKitty and see the contract address. 

**Install the CLI**

Download and install the Decentraland CLI by running the following command

```bash
npm i -g decentraland
```

For more details, follow the steps in the [Installation guide](https://docs.decentraland.org/documentation/installation-guide/).

**Previewing the scene**

Once you've installed the CLI, download this example and navigate to its directory from your terminal or command prompt.

_from the scene directory:_

```
$:  dcl start
```

Any dependencies are installed and then the CLI will open the scene in a new browser tab automatically.

**Usage**

Click the box to make it go up or down. The NFT module is used to display my favorite CryptoKitty.
